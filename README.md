# road-scene-annotation-cvat

This project demonstrates my skills in data annotation for computer vision using [CVAT](https://cvat.ai/). The goal was to annotate road scenes with objects relevant to autonomous driving and traffic analysis.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **CVAT** for labeling images
- **COCO** format for exporting annotations

## 🧠 Objects Annotated
- Cars
- Pedestrians
- Roads
- Sidewalks
- Lane Markings
- Traffic Lights
- Road Signs

## 📁 File Structure

road-data-annotation/ ├── annotations/ │ └── instances_default.json # Exported in COCO format ├── images/ # (Optional: add sample images here) └── README.md


## 💡 Use Case
This dataset simulates a real-world data labeling task for training machine learning models in road scene understanding and object detection (e.g., self-driving cars).

## 📦 Export Format
COCO 1.0
